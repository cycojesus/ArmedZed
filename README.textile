Leveraging on "ArmedSlack":http://www.armedslack.org and inspired by "Zubuntu":http://www.omegamoon.com/blog// here I'll try to get the almighty Slackware running on Sharp's Zaurus (SL-6000L (tosa) specifically as it's the only one I have handy).

In here will be found SlackBuilds scripts to generate necessary packages, configuration files and various scripts and stuff.

-------------------------------------

h3. Armedslack-current on a Tosa, How?

* download and flash a kexecboot kernel
** http://projects.linuxtogo.org/projects/kexecboot/
** http://www.angstrom-distribution.org/demo/kexecboot/
** (you can also build one through OE if you have time and disk-space...)
* mount $CARD $ROOT
* cd $ROOT
* tar xf /armedslack-devtools/minirootfs/roots/slack-current-miniroot_*.tar.bz2
* build and install SlackBuilds/crossed-linux
* nano $ROOT/etc/fstab to use /dev/root as device for /
* umount $ROOT
* boot it in Tosa
* if possible make a full installation of Armedslack
* continue by building and installing SlackBuilds/{tosa-idiosyncrasies,tslib,zaurusd}
* enjoy ;)

h4. Todo:

* detail / explain
** OE
*** toolchain
